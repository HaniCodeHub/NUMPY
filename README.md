# NumPy Operations and Tutorials

Welcome to the collection of Python NumPy tutorials and operations. This repository contains a variety of programs and examples focused on different aspects of NumPy, from basic introductions to more advanced array operations. 

## Folder Structure

1. **[01. Basic Introduction](./01.%20Basic%20Introduction)**
   - This folder contains introductory examples and basic operations in NumPy. You'll find programs that cover fundamental NumPy functionalities such as version checking and array creation.

2. **[02. Reshaping](./02.%20Reshaping)**
   - Learn how to reshape arrays in NumPy. The programs in this folder demonstrate reshaping 1D arrays to 2D arrays, understanding the shape and size of arrays, and other related array manipulations.

3. **[03. Math & Arithmetic Operations](./03.%20Math%20%26%20Arithmetic%20Operations)**
   - This folder includes programs that focus on mathematical and arithmetic operations using NumPy, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and applying mathematical functions like square root, logarithms, etc.

4. **[04. Indexing and Slicing](./04.%20Indexing%20and%20Slicing)**
   - Learn how to access, index, and slice NumPy arrays effectively. This folder demonstrates how to extract specific parts of an array using indexing and slicing techniques.

5. **[05. Stacking, Splitting, Concatenation](./05.%20Stacking,%20Splitting,%20Concatenation)**
   - Explore how to stack, split, and concatenate arrays. The examples here show how to join multiple arrays, split arrays into smaller arrays, and stack arrays vertically and horizontally.

6. **[06. Random Array Manipulations](./06.%20Random%20Array%20Manipulations)**
   - In this folder, you will find programs that demonstrate how to create and manipulate random arrays in NumPy, as well as how to generate random numbers for simulation and analysis.

7. **[07. Advanced Random Operations](./07.%20Advanced%20Random%20Operaitons)**
   - Advanced array operations and random manipulations are covered in this folder. These examples delve into more complex operations such as reshaping, sorting, and filtering random arrays.
